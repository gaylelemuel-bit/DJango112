## Notes for creating repos
1. Make sure that all of your files are saved!
2. On the terminal (make sure you're on the right folder) execute the command: **git init**
3. If you need a gitignore file, make sure to create that file and set up that correctly. 
4. Add all of the files from your project by executing: **git add -A**
5. Save all of those in a single group (it's called commit): **git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU'RE UPLOADING"**
6. Create the main branch (the space where we are going to store all of the commits): **git branch -M main**
7. Add the remote to our project (the repo from github where we are going to communicate): **git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USER/NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO.git**
8. OPTIONAL: if you want to verify to which repo it's linked **git remote -v**
9. Send everything to github (push the elements to the repo): **git push origin main**

Note: When the configuration is set, you can just add the new files, commit and push!
